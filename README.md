# Java Bubble Sort + Binary Search – Efficient Search Fundamentals

## Overview
This project demonstrates core algorithm fundamentals in Java by sorting a dataset
using Bubble Sort and then searching for a target value using Binary Search.

The program prints the low/high/mid indices during the search to show how Binary
Search reduces the search space each iteration.

---

## Project Features
- Accepts 11 integers as user input
- Sorts the dataset using Bubble Sort
- Searches for a target value using Binary Search
- Outputs intermediate search steps (low/high/mid) for transparency

---

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Sorting (Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Binary Search)
- Arrays and iteration
- Input handling with `Scanner`
- Boolean state tracking and structured logic

---

## Security & Practical Relevance
Efficient searching and filtering logic is commonly used in:
- Log analysis and alert triage
- Pattern/indicator matching
- Rule-based checks and validation
- Data parsing and transformation pipelines

---

## Tools & Environment
- Java
- Command-line execution

---

## Scope
Developed for educational purposes to demonstrate sorting and searching algorithms
and foundational programming skills.
